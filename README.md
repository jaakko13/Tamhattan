## Feature Ticket
- Every feature/addition requires an [issue to be created](https://github.com/jaakko13/Tamhattan/issues)
  - Please link the issue to the GitHub project [Tamhattan Website]([https://github.com/users/evvic/projects/3](https://github.com/users/jaakko13/projects/3))
- The issue is then developed in a branch
  - Within the **issue page** of the created issue a branch can be generated that automatically links the issue with the beanch and the GitHub Project
  - This gives the branch an ID that matches the issues ID
> If unsure how to do any of this ask *[@jaakko13](https://github.com/jaakko13)*
